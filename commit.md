# Committing our change

Make sure you've saved the script. Now, click on the **git** tab in RStudio. You'll notice that there's only one file listed -- our script -- since that's the only file that's changed.

Click on the staged box to stage our change. Now click on  **Diff** to give a summary of what's changed. Lines that have been added are green. Lines that have been removed are red.

From git's point of view, a modification to a line is actually two operations - The removal of the original line followed by the creation of the new line.
