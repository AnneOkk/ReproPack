# ISBE Symposium - Introduction to Reproducible Research in R and R Studio.

This tutorial was developed by [Mike Croucher](www.walkingrandomly.com) and [Anna Krystalli](http://annakrystalli.github.io/)

In this session, we are going to get you started with using version control from within RStudio. 

The material is self-paced and includes a worked-example. It is suggested that you work through the sections in order.

## Version control with git and github

* [Installing the software](./installing_software.md) - Get what you need on your own machine
* [Getting an account on github](./github.md) - Sign up for github
* [Creating an RStudio project](./rstudio_project.md) - Creating an example, version controlled project
* [Starting our analysis project](./analysis_start.md) - A simple script to get us started
* [Getting our project under version control](./version_control.md) - First step into a larger world
* [Making a change](./making_change.md) - Making our script more useful
* [Committing our change](./commit.md) - How to commit a change
* [Connecting our local repository to github](./github_sync.md) - Backup! Making our code available to the world.
* [Subsequent updates](./updates.md) - Now we are set up, the workflow is easy.
* [Things we haven't told you](./next_steps.md) - Steps to further learning
