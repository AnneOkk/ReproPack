# ISBE Symposium - Introduction to Reproducible Research in R and R Studio.

## Version control with git and github

## Installing R, RStudio and git

Many users of R use it from within another free piece of software called RStudio.
RStudio is a powerful and productive user interface for R. Itâ€™s free and open source, and works great on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Our first task, therefore, is to install R and RStudio.

* Install R first. Downloads are available at https://cran.rstudio.com/
  * Direct link for Windows https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
  * Direct link for MacOS X https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/
  * Direct link for Linux https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/
* Install RStudio second. Downloads are available at https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
