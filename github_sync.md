# Connecting our local repository to GitHub

Our project is fully version controlled so we have access to a detailed history of every change we've ever made to it. This is a great first step but all of this only exists on our own computers at the moment.

It's time to upload our project to GitHub!

Putting your code on GitHub confers a number of benefits:

* Everything is backed up for you.
* Your project is made available to others. This is a vital part of modern scientific dissemination.
* GitHub has a range of project management and collaboration tools that work on a per-project basis.
* Your GitHub profile can be used as part of your online-identity.

**Creating a new repository on GitHub**

* Log into GitHub and go to your profile page. On the **repositories** tab, click **New**
