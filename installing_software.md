## Installing R, RStudio and git

Many users of R use it from within another free piece of software called **RStudio.**
RStudio is a powerful and productive user interface for R. Itâ€™s free and open source, and works great on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Rstudio's version control functionality is provided by yet another software called **git**

Our first task, therefore, is to install R, RStudio and git.

**Install R**

Install R first. Downloads are available at <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/" target ="_blank">https://cran.rstudio.com/</a>  
  * Direct link for Windows <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/" target ="_blank">https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/</a>  
  * Direct link for MacOS X <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/" target ="_blank">https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/</a> 
  * Direct link for Linux <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/" target ="_blank">https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/</a>

**Install git**

Git is one of the most popular version control systems in the world. It is free and open source.

* Windows & OS X: <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads" target ="_blank">http://git-scm.com/downloads</a> 
* Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install git-core`
* Fedora/RedHat: `sudo yum install git-core`

**Configure git**

After installing git, you need to tell it who you are. Open a terminal window (**cmd.exe on windows**) and type the following

```
git config --global user.email "you@youremail.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

On succesful completion, you should see no output from these commands.
