# Create an account on github

Although git can be used on its own, most people choose to use it in conjunction with an online repository service. The most popular of these, by far, is github.

It has become so standard that some organisations will ask to see your github profile as part of job applications!

* Create a free account on github. **If you have an academic email account you should use it here.**
    * https://github.com/join

Github users can create an unlimited number of free, **public** repositories. If you want to create **private** repositories, most people need to purchase a subscription.

**Academic users can get access to an unlimited number of free private repositories.**  The key to these riches is your academic email address which has to be associated with your github account.

* If you are an academic, request free private repositories - https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new

It may take a while to receive the verification email for this step. Don't worry about this, you'll not need it for the rest of the session.
